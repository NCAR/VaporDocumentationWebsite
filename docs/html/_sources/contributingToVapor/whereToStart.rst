All contributions are welcome, and can include:

    - :ref:`Bug reports <contributing.bugReports>`
    - :ref:`Feature requests <contributing.bugReports>`
    - :ref:`Code contributions <contributing.git>`
    - :ref:`Documentation updates <contributing.documentation>`
    - :ref:`Your own visualizations to share in Vapor's gallery <contributing.visGallery>`

Vapor's current to-do list can be found on our `GitHub "issues" tab <https://github.com/ncar/vapor/issues>`_.  

If youâ€™ve found an interesting issue that you would like to help fix, write a comment stating that you would like to be assigned to it.  Assigning issues to one or more individuals helps coordination among developers.

After assignment, you can refer to this document to :ref:`set up your development environment <contributing.environment>`, and then make your contribution.  The purpose of this guide is to help developers understand what part of Vapor's architecture is relevant to their assigned issue, and how to get their fix incorporated into our *master* branch.

Feel free to ask questions on the `Vapor Discourse Forum <https://vapor.discourse.group>`_.
