Exporting Visualizations
________________________

VAPOR allows users to save visualizations either as a single image or as an image sequence.

Saving a Single Image
--------------------------

   - Go to the **Capture** menu at the top of the application.
   - Select **Single image**.
   - Choose the desired file format (TIFF or PNG).
   - Specify the location for the file and click **Save**.

How to Save an Image Sequence
-----------------------------
   - Go to the **Capture** menu at the top of the application.
   - Select **Image Sequence**.
   - Choose the desired file format (TIFF or PNG).
   - Specify the location for the sequence of files and click **Save**
   - This will begin capturing the image sequence. Each time the rendering changes a new frame will be captured. Using the animation controls at the top of the application will play through and capture each timestep, while adjusting the camera settings will provide and capture different views of the visualization.
   - When you have captured all the frames you want, go to the **Capture** menu again and select **End Image Capture**. Your captured images will be saved at the location you specified.
